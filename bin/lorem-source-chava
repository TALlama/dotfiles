echo "You're okay! What happened!?"
echo "Well, I'm glad you're alright. But did you notice-"
echo "Dick."
echo "Yes, can we see her now?"
echo "Dick, could you get her a glass of water, in case she wakes up?"
echo "Orson, could you lock the door?"
echo "Yeah, dad. They think she'll be okay. The fire burned her leg pretty bad, though."
echo "High school was hard for us both, dad, and she was my rock."
echo "I will, Mr Chancellor!"
echo "What the–?"
echo "Oh, I– this passage just clicked in my head."
echo "Goodnight, dad."
echo "(Poking her head up. She speaks hesitantly)"
echo "(Hands on hips)"
echo "We went around and found some things, and they lead us here. I'd explain it but you wouldn't understand."
echo "What, just because I'm a girl I don't get to go inside?"
echo "Alright, then you head home first."
echo "(sheepishly taking an extra and heading farther in)"
echo "Boys, you'd best come see this."
echo "This one fits the bill. Jonathan Struthers. Pyromaniac, bit of a sociopath."
echo "Well, he was by campus. We could check the student rolls."
echo "I think I could get in, yeah."
echo "(incredulous)"
echo "Boys, boys! We can check the student rolls first, and then if we come up empty we talk about the FBI."
echo "(in a whisper, holding up another sheet of paper she'd taken out of the file)"
echo "I don't know, but we're going to find out."
echo "Oh, sorry. My father met a young man on campus and asked me to come get his file."
echo "Stuthers, ma'am. Jonathan Struthers."
echo "(Shifting gears a bit unconvincingly)"
echo "I understand, ma'am. You've been so helpful already; maybe we could help you out?"
echo "(nods)"
echo "Orson went around the other way, and I'm not standing on the streetcorner by myself in this neighborhood."
echo "Orson's already going in the other way; we can't just leave him!"
echo "Yes, but out cold."
echo "(barely containing her laughter)"
echo "So the Nibelung Orphans are back in the picture. Life is going to be interesting."
echo "(unsure)"
echo "Oh, he just wants to hear about post-colonialism in Central Africa. Just rail for a bit–"
echo "(Reaching for a bottle)"
echo "(pulling Dick away from the group)"
echo "And I miss the old you that cared about this stuff, the guy I fell in love with because he wanted the world to be a better place."
echo "Which one?"
echo "More interesting than post-colonialism?"
echo "(Without looking up)"
echo "I'm… listening."
echo "We… we did have fun. But… we didn't work out, Dick. We didn't…"
echo "–you broke up. That's the end of that sentence, Richard: you two broke up! Six months ago!"
echo "And do _you_ know how _she_ feels about _him_? Because newsflash, Richard: Bao has moved on, and you need to figure that out quick."
echo "You are _not_ the best thing that ever happened to her: that's for her to decide. What you are is the guy that didn't work out. Do I need to remind you about the Napa Valley incident? Or your romantic trip to Yosemite you never quite took? Or the midnight mission dinner fiasco? You two didn't work out, and I'm sorry, but you need to know that it's over."
echo "(calling after him)"
echo "It's just _screwed up_, Orson. Like, everything is just screwed up lately. No one's thinking straight, and no one's acting like themselves!"
echo "Yeah, and it's screwed up. It's not your fault! You didn't even _do_ anything; it was Bao. It's like insanity is contagious all of a sudden and it's going around!"
echo "(embarrased)"
echo "(relieved to have a distraction)"
echo "Their class gets out in 5 minutes. If we run we'll make it!"
echo "(as he walks away)"
echo "John! I heard about your incident yesterday! What happened?"
echo "Dick."
echo "You go in and talk to him. I can't do it right now. I'm not in… A good state of mind."
echo "(smirking)"
echo "So I'm saying that they've all been acting under the influence. It wasn't Bao's fault! Or Orson's, or yours! The beer just makes people act dumb around the opposite sex!"
echo "(pleased that Richard is engaging and not pushing her away)"
echo "(suddenly very sheepish)"
echo "No!"
echo "I know, but that doesn't mean that what I did wasn't stupid."
echo "That I can get behind."
echo "And I talked to my dad, but he said that since Gamma House is off-campus, he couldn't do anything unless he had evidence for the police."
echo "(resolutely)"
echo "Dick, I need to know where you're getting the beer. It's dangerous!"
echo "My head hurts. But I'm alright."
echo "Thanks, dad."
echo "(no more hiding how hurt she is)"
echo "Yeah, sorry. I– I had this weird dream last night, and it just threw me for a loop."
echo "I was– it's dumb. I was in a forest, right? And it was night, and I got shot at. Then I woke up, and the first thing that happened was your call asking me to come to the forest and go shooting."
echo "Yeah, and in my dream I threw a tree at someone. Like I said: a dumb dream. But it just– threw me off, y'know?"
echo "They heard it back at campus."
echo "We need to at least see what it was, right? It might be in trouble."
echo "So which way do you think it went?"
echo "And tell them what? That we were out shooting where we weren't supposed to be, hit some wildlife we shouldn't have been shooting at, and could you please pick it up for us?"
echo "I thought disappearing was your thing."
echo "More of a goal than a "thing"."
echo "Do you know where the car is?"
echo "Besides, I need to know what the hell is going on here. I dreamt of that thing. Can't turn back now."
echo "Yeah, they went through here. He ditched us on purpose, and he and Sam are up to something."
echo "And that probably doesn't mean good things, right?"
echo "Stop! He doesn't deserve this!"
echo "Timothy Simmons did nothing to you, Sam! He's in there, still!"
echo "(singing mournfully)"
echo "And what I could wasn't enough. So we need to do more, and learn to do more. So I'm practicing."
echo "What the hell happened out there? You tell _us_, because you _were_ out there, and you _abandoned_ us to carry _your_ sister back from the scene of a possible _crime_ that you _knew_ about but _left_."
echo "Just get in the car."
echo "Another one."
echo "Larkin and Golden Gate."
echo "But you *weren't* hurt, and neither was Richard! I'd rather you stayed away from explosions, but this is the way to do it if you're close to one."
echo "It'll be twenty more minutes than I got last night. I just can't seem to catch any sleep, but I'll jump at the chance to use Orson's spare feather bed. Twenty minutes, though! Promise!"
echo "When Dick is the adult in the room, there is something wrong. I need a glass of water."
echo "You'll have to try harder than that."
echo "(with a sigh)"
echo "Oh, I am. But it hurts just a little knowing that she'll never remember why I'm mad at her."
echo "Okay, I'll see. But can you tell me what it is, so I can brace myself?"
echo "Sure, from your pre-law class."
echo "Involved? What makes you suspect her?"
echo "Sneak in? I'm not sure–"
echo "(caving)"
echo "Hypothetically, Dick."
echo "Then I guess we're sneaking into a garage."
echo "Amanda! Uh, hi. We're here to… join up."
echo "That party last year. You were a little tipsy, and everyone was talking politics. You were a bit- *strident* about your belief that the message had to be heard."
echo "You've certainly been loud, but I don't think you've told them what it's about."
echo "Sounds like you've got this figured out, Amanda. So you're the leader here? We talk to you to join up?"
echo "Sure, I understand. Hey, you know what would be a great target? One of the bridges!"
echo "Yeah, but the bridge is a *symbol*, you know? Everyone sees them, and everyone relies on them."
echo "(sheepishly)"
echo "Do we have more?"
echo "I told you you don't need that, Amanda."
echo "(glancing up at the figures above)"
echo "Did we get 'em?"
echo "I was under duress. You might have noticed the gun."
echo "Wh- what about Amanda?"
echo "What about Dick? Did someone go untie him?"
echo "I am. How do I look?"
echo "I feel worse than that."
echo "Being held at gunpoint? Being nearly blown up?"
echo "(remembering)"
echo "He's at Amanda's, tied to a chair, surrounded by people with guns!"
echo "He was **not**. He suspected Amanda, and he came to me so we could find out. He didn't think you would help him."
echo "Ignoring your calling me a cow, for now, I know full well that Dick and I do not work. We tried it, and we tried it again. He is brilliant when he wants to be, but despite my pushing he does not want to live up to his potential. He busies himself with parties and causes. But you two keep him in that box, never letting him inch closer to what he can be."
echo "(seething)"
echo "Did you recognize the writing?"
echo "Did you see anybody lurking around?"
echo "Who could it be? Somebody good at being sneaky."
echo "(laughing)"
echo "Could it have been Richard?"
echo "Yeah, but he could have had someone help him. Sam, maybe."
echo "What the fuck?!"
echo "323 dash what?"
echo "(reading)"
echo "Or… *pretending* to be one? Why would he hang out on campus if he was a federal agent?"
echo "Well, we can go find him and I'll pluck it out of his one-track mind."
echo "We need to know if we're in danger, Orson! He could have written that letter to spook you!"
echo "You're right, the letter is more important. But after that we'll revisit the Richard question. Give me the letter and let's see what I can read."
echo "Objects are so much harder than people. But…"
echo "Definitely a he. White guy, angry."
echo "Very quiet. Eerily quiet."
echo "Angry, but not quiet. No ideas."
echo "We'll figure it out."
echo "We're here to try to get to the bottom of this, because no one else is. There's a group of people we know who went crazy and we need to know why."
echo "He said they heard the radio reports of the explosion and freaked out. They cut him free and took off."
echo "Lay off him, okay?"
echo "I did. We need to–"
echo "There!"
echo "I know, Richard. I know."
echo "Now remember: don't tell him who we're visiting. I want it to be a surprise."
echo "You made it!"
echo "Surprise road trip!"
echo "That's the surprise part! C'mon!"
echo "And here we are!"
echo "An orphanage!"
echo "One: that does not sound fun. Two: we are here to play games with one of the kids. I've been coming here a few months and I promised her I'd bring along some new friends."
echo "Hello again, Mrs. Cobblepot. Anastasia is expecting me."
echo "Yes, a special request of hers. She has a new game she needs a group for."
echo "I did! This is Orson, who you met before. I told you about Bao, and this here is Richard. You'll have to be nice to him; he's a little slow."
echo "Bao, Richard; this is Anastasia *Simmons*."
echo "And I've merely ensured that we get in now without being smashed into paste. Well we will just have to find another way out."
echo "Honestly, Richard, he–"
echo "Hello. You're Anastasia, right? You just got in."
echo "You look like you could use someone to talk to, Anastasia. I… knew your father, and I told him I'd check in on you."
echo "You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to. Ask my friends: I can do the talking. But for now, I have this deck of cards. Maybe a game will take your mind off things?"
echo "(to Richard)"
echo "Bao dear, come sit by me. You're wasting your time over there, and you're distracting from our host."
echo "We start with the best of intentions, but it doesn't always work out how we want. We just have to make the best of it, and try to get better each day. It's not our fault that the world is broken, but it would be our fault if we stopped trying to fix it."
echo "And were they impressed by the new Rad Lab equipment, or–"
echo "**Eirwyn**?! Eirwyn!! Where the **hell** have you been!?"
echo "Eirwyn, I've looked, and 'around' is demonstratably not true. You *disappeared* without a trace!"
echo "And you couldn't leave a note or send a letter? In *3 years*?"
echo "Just shut up and give me a hug."
echo "(to Jonah)"
echo "Are you staying long? Should I go get us some drinks, or will you be gone when I return?"
echo "Then I'll go whip up some Egg Creams and be right back. I want to hear all about those three years!"
echo "You didn't go to Europe for three years and have no adventures at all! Tell me!"
echo "And you *are* coming back? To school?"
echo "On campus housing?"
echo "Well…"
echo "Freshman year. Living away from the parents, narrowing down my majors– they won't let me triple major!"
echo "I don't understand why Eirwyn ran like that. I hope she's okay. Did you see her outside?"
echo "He knew something was up, knew that Richard was in on it, knew that Eirwyn was in on it, and didn't tell me!"
echo "And *we* know that Richard's got some federal emergency code. And you saw him downtown by the FBI building, right?"
echo "There's something weird going on with him, and now I'm thinking Eirwyn has not been in Italy! We need to find out what it is, and the best place to do that is the FBI building. Your dad probably has access to the files, right?"
echo "So you could just slip in, unnoticed, and find the right file. We can read it and return it and no one will know! We can find out what Richard's really hiding!"
echo "But that's the danger, Orson! If we *don't* do this, and Richard is what we think he is, and he knows about us, and he knows about what we can do, we'll be outed to the government *and* your dad."
echo "I'm sorry what now?"
echo "And you have such happy memories of the place that you want to return?"
echo "Hey, if it's important, I can make it work, but… school?"
echo "That… that's possible. I'm in."
echo "Sam and you? *Really?*"
echo "What about you, Eirwyn? All-expenses-paid trip to Germany?"
echo "Nein, danke."
echo "Now where are the boys, anyway?"
echo "Excuse me, sir. See you three Americans? Our friends. Lost. Two men. One woman."
echo "Truck? Did they know truck-driver?"
echo "Danke shön, herr."
echo "Which just means we still have the car."
echo "I'm no good at stick, but we'll manage."
echo "I know my friends can be exhausting, but they're worth it. We help each other out, and when you need it, they'll be there for you, too."
echo "We're visiting a few friends of ours. They visited us last week and we showed them a good time, and now it's our turn to visit them."
echo "No, it does not."
echo "So naturally, we should go explore the creepy woods."
echo "This is creepy, right? It's not just me?"
echo "Good."
echo "It's just like old times when… we've never done this before."
echo "We always end up at orphanages."
echo "We should get inside."
echo "Run! Now!"
echo "Left!"
echo "I looked up plans, all right? Right!"
echo "The German military used a lot of the same plans! We just need to loop back out of here! Right!"
echo "(panting)"
echo "It's going to be okay, Orson. I know this was hard. But you did it, and now we're clear. We just need to get that file back to your dad."
echo "That was stupid. Next time you go galavanting about, at least give me a heads up."
echo "Oh, I know, and I don't blame you. But he's not in a good place, and I think you knew that. Next time I just want a shout in my direction as warning. Deal?"
echo "It's going all right, but there's just so much going on. I still haven't decided what I'm actually majoring in, my friends are everywhere and they're deciding what *they're* doing."
echo "I know, mom, I know."
echo "Just a thank you note for keeping Orson company. I'd sent him a note last week because he was kind enough to pay for the whole Germany trip, and he was returning the favor."
echo "That's where Orson wanted to go, and he asked very nicely."
echo "He's still around, he just doesn't come around anymore."
echo "We had different interests: I wanted to focus on academics, and he wanted to do everything but."
echo "Marcus was just saying thanks. I don't know the guy, but I thought he was just being nice."
echo "No… why should you be worried about Mr. Krieg? He gives the school a ton of money; you've known him forever. Should *I* be worried about something?"
echo "Thank you for looking out for me, daddy. I know I can always come to you for help."
echo "(smiling)"
echo "I'll find some way to manage."
echo "Hello? Oh Hi, Eirwyn."
echo "Yeah, Dick. Have you not met Dick? How is that possible?"
echo "We *should* all get together and do something. Got plans tonight?"
echo "Well now you do! Come over when you get off and we'll *do something*."
echo "No, Bucky's great. He came to campus last year while you were gone, and…"
echo "No problem; this is a great night out. Pity Orson couldn't make it."
echo "Wait, you *did* see him?"
echo "Is there some reason I should be wary of you, Mr. Krieg?"
echo "And I'm sure I've said some not nice things about my father, but that's what kids will do."
echo "I'm not a lapdog, like Sam is. I won't blindly follow orders like Richard will. I'm trying to find out what's going on because I'm smart enough to figure out that there *is* something going on. I know that you know more than I do, but that's right now. I would love to find out what you know, and maybe I can do some work for you to increase my knowledge, but know that I'm not going to be one of the puppets you play."
echo "Oh, excuse me; I didn't mean– oh, I'd bump into you any time."
echo "Third time's the charm, I guess."
echo "I'm not equipped to sneak in, but I know who is."
echo "Hey, Orson; I need a favor."
echo "What?!"
echo "What are you talking about?"
echo "Where did they take her?"
echo "This seems to be a vital part of your plan that you're missing."
echo "All right, what do we know? Were they…"
echo "OK, so not The Fury."
echo "Let's meet at the library on campus and see if we can dig anything up in the newspaper archive."
echo "Marcus, you'll have to wait."
echo "They aren't very subtle, that's for sure. The tattoos are mentioned in these six articles, and of those, this warehouse was fingered in two gang-violence reports in the last week alone. So now we know where they are; what are we doing with that information?"
echo "Is that really the best plan? Shouldn't we call the police?"
echo "No, you're right. Let's go."
echo "I'm sorry, Dick. Really sorry."
echo "You've got the guns; let me drive."
echo "Not your best plan."
echo "No."
echo "We have bleeding people here. Let's talk about this later."
echo "And so while I had good intelligence that the individual in your picture was indeed at the warehouse mentioned, I was unable to verify his presence due to the immediate need to find Eirwyn. That call happened to be a happy accident, as it brought our attention to another Enhanced with similar abilities. While that was fortunate, what was unfortunate was what I found when I returned to the warehouse: the operation had moved on."
echo "A lab. We've been to so many labs lately."
echo "It was too dark to see."
echo "That'd be great, but I didn't see anything."
echo "No, I– wait. Yes. I didn't at the time but now… the one who was shot… it sounded like that guy outside University House the night Eirwyn arrived."
echo "So we definitely do the Golden Gate. And Chinatown. How long is he here? Do we do Yosemite?"
echo "Ooh, we *could* do Disneyland. It's a drive, but it's worth it."
echo "We're planning a trip!"
echo "Richard, where–"
echo "A friend of yours from the service?"
echo "Pleased to meet you, Axel."
echo "And I'm *so* looking forward to that! But right now it's all cramming. I'll do fine, I'm sure, but next semester I think I'll take a lighter load."
echo "Yeah, dad, I–"
echo "(taken aback)"
echo "But now I think I should get back to studying. Thanks for dinner, Mom."
echo "It's just– everyone *knows*. My life is this campus, and no matter where I go, I get that *look* that says they know. I can *feel* it even when I'm not watching. It's like everyone is scared of getting too close, but more scared of ignoring me."
echo "(eyes still closed)"
echo "Richard, please, not right now."
echo "Thank you, Dick."
echo "There is. Would you go to my biology class and pick up my homework? I didn't make it there today."
echo "There's something you can do, too, Richard."
echo "What's a 323 dash 8?"
echo "Yeah, a federal one. And let's drop the game here, because you know I don't come into these kind of conversations blindly. I know, and I want you to tell me the truth."
echo "Barry? What are you doing here? And what happened to your clothes?"
echo "Yes, it's Barry from the Rad Lab."
echo "(eyes wide)"
echo "Oh, no need to go! Stay! No one's going to bother us in here unless I ask for it, and looking like that out there you're going to be noticed."
echo "(motioning to the bags of food)"
echo "Richard, it's a 323-8."
echo "You don't want to leave, Barry! Trust us. We can help."
echo "Richard, the Rad Lab was my dad's pet project. He helped found it and made sure they got the all funding they needed– it was like another child to him. They do work for the military and the government. It's permitted."
echo "Maybe you didn't know, because you didn't have the clearance."
echo "Listen to me. I know you trust Richard for some reason. I do, too. But he's neck deep in this, and there are people he knows that will take people like you and put them in places where no one will ever see them again. Those people include Sam, her boss Marcus, and likely more. You need to be *very* careful going forward. You need to be on your toes and ready for anything, because anything is going to happen to you."
echo "Dick and Barry's paths haven't crossed much, but Barry is a supporter of the movement, and wanted to help in any way he could."
echo "Barry's all about movement."
echo "I've listened to the news, but they don't report much."
echo "Of course."
echo "So how did you meet Dick, John?"
echo "Well it's nice of you to open your house to us. Thank you."
echo "Well we're out now, and it's been about five minutes…"
echo "Well that would start later…"
echo "Barry saved us from a madman is what happened. Barry's special, and I know that's not something you're used to– we're still getting used to it– but if we don't get out of here now the march tomorrow will be completely overshadowed by this. Barry and I are here to help, not draw the attention away from the real problems you face. Let's keep the spotlight where it belongs, on the racial issues."
echo "I don't really understand, either."
echo "What time does the march start tomorrow?"
echo "If he does what you're asking, that's the only thing that gets into the papers. No one will write about what actually happens at the march; they'll only talk about the guy zooming around the edge."
echo "It's not time for that, now. This is Barry's time to support, not be in the spotlight."
echo "I think you're being a distraction. Lie low."
echo "No, just… don't be as visible."
echo "It's not like that."
echo "There was… an altercation. We had a run in with some guy, and Barry did some things that he's not proud of, and he knocked the other guy out. We're trying to focus on tomorrow's march. He's here to support tha march and doesn't want to be a distraction. I know this is important to you, and we're trying to help, and we don't – **I don't** – want to make it more difficult than it already is."
echo "I'll try to make it up to you."
echo "Not the stairwell! The fire escape!"
echo "…being a distraction. Lie low."
echo "Please no. Don't be there."
echo "Not without Dick. There!"
echo "You're a good man, Barry West."
echo "If you turn him in, he could end up as the next Timothy Simmons."
echo "I was *there*. I talked to him. I was caught in that firefight."
echo "The people who did that to Timothy cannot be trusted with the care of Barry. You can't let that happen."
echo "Richard's behind the Wells Fargo downtown, he's injured, and he's there protecting you so be careful. Run, Barry, run!"
echo "Now, there's no need to get violent. We're here to help, agent. Let us do that much. We can sort out the other things later. Right now we have a bleeding man who needs medical attention."
echo "Go call for an ambulance!"
echo "You have a leak in your organization. I can help find it."
echo "I have. And I'm worried about him, but it can't mean that the world stops."
echo "No, but I'm working that angle. It's someone who has it out for Barry, so it's likely one of the other two rad lab researchers, both of whom were presumed dead. When I know you'll know. Did your sources find out anything about the explosion at the rad lab? It's too suspicious to be an accident…"
echo "Does… does Kriemhild have any resources that they can use to help Agent Smith?"
echo "He's worth investing in. He's been a valuable asset in the past, and keeping him active is a smart play."
echo "My skills are best suited for finding the perpetrator. And I do intend to find him. And when I know, you'll know. I'll endeavor to make that soon."
echo "(whispering)"
echo "Come with me; there's not much time."
echo "How much of that did you hear? I'm not asking to cover up anything; I need to know where to start so we can be quick."
echo "Right. It doesn't. It keeps plowing on no matter how much I'd like it to slow down. I've been working for your father. Little jobs, fact finding stuff. Trying to find out– trying to prove what we suspected."
echo "And it's all true. Richard *does* work for the FBI. Your father *does* do secret research for the government's Kriemhild project. Sam *does* all the dirty work we feared. And I had to keep it all from you because he made me promise not to tell you. It hurt to do it, and I'm sorry."
echo "What? No! No, I'm trying to get him out."
echo "Your father, I'm afraid, is going to be with us for some time. He's mired deep in all of this, and we'll have no hope of untangling it if he's not in the center to guide us."
echo "We'll manage. We'll figure it out. These are institutions build of shadows, and we can hide inside as we dismantle them. We're good at that."
echo "It's been so long since I've seen anyone. Have you seen Orson, lately?"
echo "One of your cousins from Italy?"
echo "It's been too long since we did this, right? Too long away from each other, since we caught up."
echo "So let's make this a standing date. Let's get the three of us together and catch up. Every week?"
echo "(still engrossed in her slot machine; she's not heard a word)"
echo "Orson, enough. We've all kept secrets. Sometimes for very good reasons, and sometimes not. But we can't begrudge each other some privacy in our dealings."
echo "Which authority covers organized crime cases?"
echo "So we call in and grab some backup."
echo "(trying too hard not to look at Diana)"
echo "Whoa, whoa! Orson, put the gun down. It's just Bao. We're here _with_ Bao."
echo "You're right, Bao. He's a liar. Now come with me and let's go get birthday drinks."
echo "Diana's on the run from the mob. Richard is trying to help her. Right now she needs to relax, and you can help her do that, but we can't do it in _that_ room with _that_ many people. It's exciting, right?"
echo "The mob. Now let's go before they notice we're lagging behind."
echo "Orson, you need to cool off. You're mad at everyone and everything, lately. You're pushing away the people you need to help you, and you're just making it impossible for us to help. It's been a hard time lately– for *all* of us– but we haven't been giving each other the slack we need. Try slowing down a bit. Take a break."
echo "Orson! Diana's making a break for it! Follow her!"
echo "Everybody! This way! Diana's trying to frame us!"
echo "We just need to swing by the bar for Eirwyn and Bao."
echo "Are you crazy? We're not leaving them!"
echo "It's Bao's _birthday_."
echo "You know, we can’t even do a proper vacation. Trouble seems to follow us around. You think it’s us…"
echo "…or one of them?"
echo "It's great, except for Professor Terrance. I should have listened to you; he is _awful_, and now I'm stuck in the class for a whole semester."
echo "As with Professor Terrance, I should have listened to you, and not gone. Let's leave it at that?"
echo "Claudia!"
echo "Oh no you don't."
echo "Run!"
echo "So was that alien from your planet, or another one?"
echo "Because it shot at you, so it's probably something about your past on that other planet that you're from."
echo "No, just like you don't mean Italy when you say \"Italy.\""
echo "Yes, but you're not. You're stressed out. The world is out to get you. Right now you need a friend, and I'm offering, but I can't help if you don't tell me the truth."
echo "I'm sorry I wasn't there for you."
echo "I'm glad that Orson was there, and I'm sorry… so very sorry I wasn't."
echo "But there's nothing to be done. He wants the attention; he's angling for it."
echo "What's your plan?"
echo "No, he's happy to be the martyr."
echo "We call Marcus."
echo "Hey."
echo "But Marcus' sources say there's more money coming out of here than cotton candy proceeds would explain. Something else is for sale here."
echo "Yes, quite forthcoming."
echo "Remember that… beer you had not half an hour ago? Yeah, remember… what you need to do next…"
echo "Orson, help!"
echo "Confirmed that Horn was on scene, and these files detail the sales we suspected. But no Brunette."
echo "I did as I was told. Now the answers. Who's the Brunette?"
echo "She was you before you were you."
echo "Not arguing. Why'd she leave? Better offer?"
echo "I have my ways, and you yours. They don't match, and I don't think we need to compare notes."
echo "Oh, come on: you *had* that!"
echo "Of course!"
echo "It was. Now let's see what we can do with it."
echo "Thanks for being there when we needed you."
echo "Macroevolution Ethology via Transgenic Adaptation. It's a really interesting field, and it's exciting to get in while it's still small."
echo "Thank you for coming. My mother treasures the normality of hosting."
echo "There always is."
echo "…yes?"
echo "Rob Douglas' kid?"
echo "He… *HE* killed my father?"
echo "More."
echo "You think she was involved?"
echo "Eirwyn and I haven't… we haven't been on the best of terms since she got back. But I think I might have a way in. I'll follow this lead. Thank you. Thank you so much."
echo "So Eirwyn's an alien, right?"
echo "First off she knows very little about Italy. Second, I have my ways."
echo "And Axel… you remember Axel, right?"
echo "Axel is an assassin who's worked for her people."
echo "I'm getting the feeling you knew all this and never told me."
echo "And did you know…"
echo "(crushed)"
echo "You didn't tell me the most important–"
echo "But you've known since the call to the CIA, and–"
echo "I'm not sure we can trust Eirwyn."
echo "Any trouble?"
echo "That bad, huh?"
echo "Never figured that it'd be the two of us smuggling contraband out of the city. It… doesn't feel great."
echo "Right. Knowing that you're on my side makes me feel safer, I can tell you that."
